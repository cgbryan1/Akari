# a09-akari

## Introduction

In this assignment, I used the model-view-controller design pattern together with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle akari.

This project was completed for Dr. Prairie Goodwin's COMP 301 at UNC Chapel Hill, with some starter code (optional interfaces and suggested steps) provided. Model, Puzzle, and Controller interfaces were provided as well as standard JavaFX interfaces. Parts of this ReadMe are excerpted from the original assignment's ReadMe.

These are the web resources I used to plan my project:
[The Akari Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Up_(puzzle))
[Practice Akari puzzles](https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/)

This app allows users to play akari and solve a variety of built-in puzzles. 


## Running the application

This assignment uses Maven as a build manager, and JavaFX as a GUI library. JavaFX has already been added as a Maven dependency to the POM file.

To run the application with Maven in IntelliJ, follow these steps:

1. Click the vertical "Maven" expansion tab which is on the right side of the IntelliJ window.

2. Expand the "Plugins" folder.

3. Expand the "javafx" folder.

4. Double-click "javafx:run" to run the project.
