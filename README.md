# Akari

## Introduction

In this project, I used the model-view-controller design pattern together with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle akari. This app allows users to play akari and solve a variety of built-in puzzles. 

This project was completed for Dr. Prairie Goodwin's COMP 301 at UNC Chapel Hill, with some starter code (optional interfaces and suggested steps) provided. Model, Puzzle, and Controller interfaces were provided as well as standard JavaFX interfaces. Parts of this ReadMe are excerpted from the original project's ReadMe.

I also used [The Akari Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Up_(puzzle)) and [Practice Akari puzzles](https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/) as references for this project.


## Running the application

This project uses Maven as a build manager, and JavaFX as a GUI library. JavaFX has already been added as a Maven dependency to the POM file.

To run the application with Maven in IntelliJ, follow these steps:

1. Click the vertical "Maven" expansion tab
2. Expand the "Plugins" folder.
3. Expand the "javafx" folder.
4. Double-click "javafx:run" to run the project.


I apologize for the odd access of this project - since this was completed for a class, I am unable to share my work publicly through a traditional GitHub repo. Thanks for your patience!
